title: Starbound Reverse Engineering
---

Welcome to the Starbound reverse engineering hub! This is a community-maintained, unofficial website to collect information
about reverse engineering [Starbound](http://playstarbound.com). This website is open-source - you can help us reverse engineer
the game and offer your discoveries by submitting a pull request to [SirCmpwn/starbound-dev](https://github.com/SirCmpwn/starbound-dev).

This is **not** a hub for modding. If you're interested in modding, [start here](http://starbounder.org/Modding). This is for
reverse engineering and creating entirely new software in the Starbound ecosystem.

## Help wanted

* [Networking](/networking): A work-in-progress. Help decoding and documenting the protocol would be great.
  * More pages documeting the connection procedure and other info would be great.
* <span class="text-danger">Level Format</span>: This page needs to be written
